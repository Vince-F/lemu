# Getting started

## Start screen

When you open Lemu, it will present you with a screen allowing to either open an existing BackstopJS json configuration file or create a new one.

If you create a new one, you will need to select a directory where the configuration file will be created.

If you want to open an existing one, just choose the "backstopn.json" file you want.

## Configuration screen
The configuration section will allow you to edit your configuration file.
