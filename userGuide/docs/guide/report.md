# Report section

Report view allows you to see the last generated report from BackstopJS. 

You can also approve your tests from here. This will approve all the tests. If you want to approve one single test, or only a single viewport, refer to the [test section]()

/!\ Careful: this will display the last generated report made by BackstopJS. If you happen to run a single test, the report will only contain this test.
