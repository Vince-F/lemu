# Engine script template

You can create templates of engine scripts.

Those are very similar to engine scripts in your configuration.

To access them on the start screen, click on "Manage templates".

You give them a name (the ".js" extension will be added automatically).
Then write your script content.

You can then use this test inside your configuration when you edit it.
Just create a new script and select your newly created template, this newly created script will be like your template.
