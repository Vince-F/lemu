## The basics

Go to the "Tests" section (in the lesft menu), and add a new test by cliking "Add" button on top of the tests list, or the "Add test" button in the center of your screen (if no test is opened). Then select the test you have just created.

A test, or scenario, consists of one endpoint page (the on you want to test). You define it in the "url" field. You should also defined a unique "label" to identify your test.

"label" and "url" are the only required field for your test. You can add more field to achieve more advance tests. Refer to the [tests]() section.
