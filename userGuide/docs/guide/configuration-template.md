# Configuration templates

Configuration templates allow you to create a new BackstopJS configuration with your own setup.

To access them, in the start screen, you can click on the "Manage .

Then you can create your configuration template. It looks like the "general configuration" content. You can set the values you want that will be reused as a base for your future configuration.

When you create a new configuration you can choose your template in the "template" field.
