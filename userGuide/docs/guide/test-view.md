# Test view
The test view is divided in two parts. On the left, you have the menu to select your tests, and on the right the currently selected test.

From the menu you can add new test, by clicking on the "add button" on top. Alongside each test on the right, the status of the test is displayed along with a "..." button which allows you to select an action to execute on this test. From there, you can:
- run the test
- approve the test
- duplicate the test
- delete the test

You can filter your tests to find them easily.
