<template><div><h1 id="report-section" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#report-section" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Report section</h1>
<p>Report view allows you to see the last generated report from BackstopJS.</p>
<p>You can also approve your tests from here. This will approve all the tests. If you want to approve one single test, or only a single viewport, refer to the <a href="/guide/test-result">test section</a></p>
<p>/!\ Careful: this will display the last generated report made by BackstopJS. If you happen to run a single test, the report will only contain this test.</p>
